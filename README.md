### Project Overview:
This project required us to build a HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a JavaScript data file using filters on the page. The filters will allow us to sort through the many different sightings contained in the data set. 

### Results:
#### From the image below, we have five filters to choose from - date, city, state, country, and shape. Users can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further sort the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

### Summary:
The finished webpage looks good and allow the users to filter through the different sightings in our data set using the search bars provided. One interesting shortcoming of our search bar is the requirement for lower-case entries. It would be preferable to allow users to enter information in the search bars in other forms than all lower-case letters. Currently, if you enter the city, state, country, or shape using all caps or beginning with a capital letter, no result will be returned. Also, users are not currently allowed to add their own UFO sightings to the webpage. I think it would be great to have a separate are where users could provide specific information about their sightings for review/follow up and perhaps have them eventually added to the site.
